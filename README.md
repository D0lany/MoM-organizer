# MoM-organizer

This software is used to simply replace save files in Mages of Mystralia.
Just specify your base save directory: C:\Users\YourName\AppData\LocalLow\Borealys Games Inc_\Mages of Mystralia
and the directory you put your practice saves in: C:\Users\YourName\AppData\LocalLow\Borealys Games Inc_\Mages of Mystralia\saveResources

Your practice saves have to each be in its own folder inside the base folder you specified, just containing the save files.

The button "update resources" reloads the list of save resources and writes the values of both input fields into local preferences, so they persist through restart.

The button "load save" copies the save files of the selected save resource into the selected Slots folder. The save files in the Slots folder are being deleted.
